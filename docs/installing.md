You can find installers for Before Dawn on github in the
[Releases section](https://github.com/muffinista/before-dawn/releases)
of the project. Installing on OSX or Windows should be as simple as
downloading the appropriate file, and running it locally. Installing
on Linux is a little more involved, and I will add documentation for
that as soon as I can.

The first time you install it, you will need to run Before Dawn
manually. The preferences window will open, and you can pick a
screensaver and set whether you want Before Dawn to automatically load
when your system boots, and you can tweak some other settings as well.

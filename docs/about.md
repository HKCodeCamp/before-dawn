  <p>Before Dawn is a an open-source, cross-platform screensaver
    application using web-based technologies. You can generate
    screensavers with it using HTML/CSS, javascript, canvas, and any tools
    that rely on those technologies. In theory, generating a Before Dawn
    screensaver is as simple as writing an HTML page.</p>

  <p>The project developed out of a personal project to explore the history
    of early screensavers. I decided that I wanted to write a framework
    that I could use to actually run screensavers on my computer. I wanted
    it to be cross-platform and easily accessible to artists and
    developers.</p>

  <p>Before Dawn is definitely a bit of a experiment -- to actually use it,
    you need to run it as a separate application on your computer and
    disable whatever screensaver you have running in your OS, but it is
    fun and definitely works.</p>
